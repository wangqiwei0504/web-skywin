          The market is 'almost certain' that the U.S. Securities and Exchange
          Commission will approve a spot Bitcoin ETF before January 10. As
          cryptocurrencies continue to rise, it is certain to continue climbing
          above the $55,000 mark. Our data analysis team's futures market data
          may indicate that U.S. entities have been one of the main drivers of
          Bitcoin's rise. The data suggests that bullish Bitcoin options bets
          are dominant.

          According to a report by Cointelegraph, PwC's 2023 Cryptocurrency
          Regulatory Report states that in 2023, 25 countries/regions have
          established stablecoin legislation or regulation. These countries
          include Austria, Finland, France, and most have also implemented other
          cryptocurrency-related regulations. The report assessed the regulatory
          status in 43 countries, finding that nations like the United States
          and the United Kingdom have not yet completed stablecoin legislation.
          About 18% of jurisdictions have not started stablecoin regulation,
          including Bahrain, Brazil, India, Taiwan, and Turkey. Meanwhile, 23%
          of regions have initiated the stablecoin regulatory process, including
          Australia, Hong Kong, and Singapore.
